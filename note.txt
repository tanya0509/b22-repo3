We just published our local git repo
to remote GitHub.com repository
Feq thing happened:
1. It automatically created new Remote Repo
under your GitHub.com account
2.Made the connection with your local git repo
3.Added all your commits to remote repo


Now our work will continue locally

1. add a new file called note.txt
2. commited the change to local repo
3. we want this change to be reflected in remote repository so We PUSHED local commits to remote repository using push origin button
4. Observe it had been added in your repository under GitHub.com
